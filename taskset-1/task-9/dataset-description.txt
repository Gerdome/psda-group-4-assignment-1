- DF001..004, each including different fault modes (one or two faults)
- Test and train set each
- Data sets consists of multiple multivariate time series
    -> Each time series is from a different engine â€“ i.e., the data can be considered to be from a fleet of engines of the same type
    -> Each engine starts with different degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation which is unknown to the user (Wear and variation is considered normal, i.e., it is not considered a fault condition)
    -> Three operational settings that have a substantial effect on engine performance. These settings are also included in the data
    -> The data is contaminated with sensor noise!
    -> Engine is operating normally at the start of each time series, and develops a fault at some point during the series. In the training set, the fault grows in magnitude until system failure
    -> In test set, the time series ends some time prior(!) to system failure
- Also provided a vector of true Remaining Useful Life (RUL) values for the test data
- The columns correspond to:
    1)  unit number
    2)  time, in cycles

    3)  operational setting 1
    4)  operational setting 2
    5)  operational setting 3
    
    6)  sensor measurement  1
    7)  sensor measurement  2
    ...
    26) sensor measurement  26

==> Objective of the competition is to predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure in the test set, i.e., the number of operational cycles after the last cycle that the engine will continue to operate
